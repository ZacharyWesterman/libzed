/** \mainpage Introduction

This library contains useful classes and functions for quick and simple data manipulation.

The idea is that this will help decrease development time of other projects.

--------------------------
All code is under the `z` namespace.

--------------------------

## z::core
Contains core functionality such as strings, arrays, and timers. No dependencies apart from stl.

## z::file
Has several classes for easy file system management.


## z::math
Mathematical constants and functions are defined here. No dependencies apart from stl.


## z::util
Contains classes that provide more complicated functionality.

## z::system
