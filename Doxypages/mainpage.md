/** \mainpage Introduction

This library contains useful classes and functions for quick and simple data manipulation.  
The idea is that this will help decrease development time of other projects.  

--------------------------
All code is under the `z` namespace. Currently, there are four other namespaces below that:  

z::core<br/>
z::file<br/>
z::math<br/>
z::util<br/>
z::system<br/>

All functions, classes and definitions are in one of these namespaces.  
The only exceptions are the three basic type definitions z::Char, z::Int and z::Float.

--------------------------

## z::core
Contains core functionality such as strings, arrays, and timers. No dependencies apart from stl.

#### Examples:
[Strings](@ref md_Doxypages_examples_core_string)


## z::file
Has several classes for easy file system management.


## z::math
Mathematical constants and functions are defined here. No dependencies apart from stl.


## z::util
Contains classes that provide more complicated functionality.

#### Examples:
[Regex](@ref md_Doxypages_examples_util_regex)


## z::system
Contains classes that allow interaction with and information about the user's system.
