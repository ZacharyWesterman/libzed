# Introduction

This collection of header-only C++ libraries contains useful classes and functions that help decrease development time of other projects.  
All code is under the **z** namespace. Currently, there are four other namespaces below that:  

**z::core**<br/>
**z::file**<br/>
**z::math**<br/>
**z::util**<br/>
**z::system**<br/>

All functions, classes and definitions are in one of these namespaces.  
The only exceptions are the three basic type definitions `Char`, `Int` and `Float` that are in the `z` namespace.

--------------------------
## z::core
Contains core functionality such as strings, arrays, and timers. No dependencies apart from stl.

## z::file
Has several classes for easy file system management.

## z::math
Mathematical constants and functions are defined here. No dependencies apart from stl.

## z::util
Contains classes that provide more complicated functionality.

## z::system
Contains classes that allow interaction with and information about the user's system.
