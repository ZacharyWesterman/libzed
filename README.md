# zLibraries

A collection of libraries for use with other projects.

All libraries will be in the **z** namespace.
Currently, there are three libraries:
- core
- file
- math

And one file required by all libraries: **z/float.h**


Sample programs and full code documentation available at [ZacharyWesterman.github.io](https://ZacharyWesterman.github.io).
